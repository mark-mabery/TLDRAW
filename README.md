## Local Development

To work on the packages (@tldraw/core or @tldraw/tldraw), you'll want to run the dev server.

1. Download or clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open the local site at `https://localhost:5000`.

To work on the app itself (that embeds @tldraw/tldraw), run the Next.js app:

   ```bash
   yarn start:www
   ```
